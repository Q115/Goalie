Get support from friends to reach your goals. Create a goal, and then assign a friend be your referee. The referee will keep you accountable, and they can also help you along the way by sending you reminders. For extra incentive to reach your goals, try wagering your reputation points on the outcome. 


## How to contribute

If you find any bugs or have suggestions on how to improve the app, please open an issue and I'll gladly discuss it with you there.

To contribute with a fix, patch, new feature, or other improvements, simply create a pull request against the appropriate branch. Please open an issue to discuss your code intentions before submitting the pull request, so I know what to look for when reviewing your submission. Once the code has been merged into the master branch, I'll gladly publish a new version of the app to include your changes so you can see your work live in the Google Play store.


## Code style and structure

Follow good programming practices and please maintain as much consistency with the rest of the project. Utilize MVP architecture for all Activities and core Fragments (Dialogs are not held to this standard at this time). 

## Backend server

Backend server code is not open source at this time, so unit test will fail if you don't have a local server setup (will fix this problem soon). Once you submit a pull request, I'll run the test suites against my local server to make sure things are OK. If you have a feature you'd like to add that requires server integration, please mock the REST calls and the results that you wish to get back, I'll implement the logic on the server once you make a pull request.

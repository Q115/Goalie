Get support from friends to reach your goals. Create a goal, and then assign a friend be your referee. The referee will help keep you accountable, and they can also help you along the way by sending you reminders. For extra incentive to reach your goals, try wagering your reputation points on the outcome. 


## How to contribute

If you find any bugs or have suggestions on how to improve the app, please open an issue and I'll gladly discuss it with you there.

To contribute with a fix, patch, new feature, or other improvements, simply create a pull request against the appropriate branch. Please open an issue to discuss your code intentions before submitting the pull request, so I know what to look for when reviewing your submission. Once the code has been merged into the master branch, I'll gladly publish a new version of the app to include your changes so you can see your work live in the Google Play store.


## Code style and structure

Follow good programming practices and please maintain as much consistency with the rest of the project. Utilize good MVP architecture for all Activities and core Fragments (Dialogs are not held to this standard at this time).
